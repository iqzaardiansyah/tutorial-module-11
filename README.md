<summary>Tutorial: Hello Minikube</summary>

1. Compare the application logs before and after you exposed it as a Service. Try to open the app several times while the proxy into the Service is running. What do you see in the logs? Does the number of logs increase each time you open the app?

    Before exposing the application as a service, we might have primarily seen logs related to the application itself running within the Docker container. These logs could include startup messages, any errors or warnings encountered during execution, and any other relevant information generated by the application.

    After exposing the application as a service and accessing it through a proxy running in Minikube via `kubectl`, the logs would likely show additional activity related to network communication and requests being handled by the service. Each time the app is opened through the proxy, there would be an increase in the number of logs reflecting incoming requests, the processing of those requests by the service, and any responses sent back to the client.

    The number of logs would indeed increase each time we open the app, as each interaction triggers logging activity in response to incoming requests and their processing by the service. This increase in logs provides a clear indication of the service's activity and its responsiveness to client requests.

2. Notice that there are two versions of `kubectl get` invocation during this tutorial section.The first does not have any option, while the latter has `-n` option with value set to `kube-system`. What is the purpose of the `-n` option and why did the output not list the pods/services that you explicitly created?

    The `-n` option in `kubectl get` is used to specify the namespace in which to list resources. A Kubernetes namespace provides a way to logically partition cluster resources and allows multiple users or teams to share the same cluster without interfering with each other. When there is no namespace specified, `kubectl` typically defaults to the `default` namespace.

    In the tutorial, the first `kubectl get` invocation did not include the `-n` option, so it listed resources from the default namespace, which may not have included the resources we explicitly created if we created them in a different namespace.

    The second `kubectl get` invocation included the `-n` option with the value set to `kube-system`, so it listed resources specifically from the `kube-system` namespace. This namespace typically contains Kubernetes system components and infrastructure-related resources.

    If we explicitly created pods and services in a different namespace, we would need to specify that namespace using the `-n` option in `kubectl get` to see those resources listed in the output. For example:

    ```
    kubectl get pods,services -n <namespace>
    ```

    Replace `<namespace>` with the name of the namespace where we created the resources. This will list pods and services specifically from that namespace. If we created resources in the `default` namespace and want to see them, we can simply omit the `-n` option, as resources from the `default` namespace are listed by default.
